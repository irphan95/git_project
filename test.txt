The kube-apiserver is the entry point for all the RESTful API calls made to Kubernetes. It validates and processes these API requests, such as creating, updating, or deleting resources like pods, services, deployments, and more. It enforces authentication, authorization, and admission control policies, ensuring that only authorized users and components can perform certain actions within the cluster.
